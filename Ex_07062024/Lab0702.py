#string has some function
#print(),input(),formate(),type().len(),id().max(),min() ETC.

name = 'john'
print(id(name))#id is unique -it will give the memory address of the variable where it is stored.
name = 'jane'

#how to print index number
a = "Amit"
print(a[2]) #output is i
#if you give -1 value it start from the end
print(a[-1])# output is t

#in python string are immutable - means its cant be change
a = "Amit"
