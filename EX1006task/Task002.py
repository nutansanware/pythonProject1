# 1 Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8

num = 2
square = num ** 2
cube = num ** 3
print(f'Given number : {num} ')
print(f'number of square : {square} ')
print(f'number of cube : {cube} ')

# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

X = input("enter the first number :")
Y = input("enter the second number :")
print("first number is greater" if X > Y else "second number is less")
print("first number is equal" if X == Y else "second number is not equal")
